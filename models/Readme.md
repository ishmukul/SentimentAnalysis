Models from Neural networks saved here.  

h5py package required for using these models.
pickle package required for unpickling tokenizer handle.

**tokenizer_10k.pickle**: Tokenizer file; supporting RNN model. Tokenizer can be common for any model. It is from 1.6M training set with 10000 word limit.  

**rnn_model.h5**: Recurrent Neural network model trained on 1.6M tweets training set.  

Due to large size, every model is not uploaded on Github.
